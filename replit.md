## Project Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)

- **Components:**
  - `balance-card.tsx` - Hero card showing who owes whom with color-coded states

  - `transaction-list.tsx` - Beautiful list of all transactions with timestamps
  - `settings-dialog.tsx` - Dialog to customize user names

  - `POST /api/settle` - Clear all balances and transactions
  - `GET /api/users` - Get user configuration
  - `PUT /api/users` - Update user names

### Data Schema

- **UserConfig:** id, user1Name, user2Name
- **Balance:** Computed - shows net balance between users

## Design System
